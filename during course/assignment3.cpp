Problem1: Define a class Complex with attributes real(constant) and imag and a constant member function to return the real value and normal function to return the imaginary value of complex number. Display the complex number outside the class using constant functions.

Problem2: Modify above program for constant object.

Problem3: Define a class Complex with members real and imag. Use constructor to construct the objects of the class Complex. Using static data member and static function, display the total number of object created before terminating the program.

Problem4: Define a class Complex with members real and imag. Use constructor to construct the objects of the class Complex. Using friend function calculate the magnitude of the Complex number.
